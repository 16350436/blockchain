- In the crypto world, there are three important layers:
  1. Technology (Blockchain)
  2. Protocol (Bitcoin - BTC is not just a currency, it is an actual protocol)
  3. Token
- Bitcoin Monetary Policy:
  1. The Halving: Number of Bitcoin released into the system, is halved every 210000 blocks.
  2. Block Frequency.

- Hashrate Distribution: https://www.blockchain.com/pools
- CPU = Central Processing Unit (General) (< 10 MH/s)
  GPU = Graphics Processing Unit (Specialized) (< 1GH/s)
  ASIC = Application-Specific Intergrated Circuit (Totally Specialized) (> 1,000 GH/s)
- 21 million is the maximum number of bitcoins that will eever be in circulation and by the year 2140 this will happen.
- A Mempool is a storage area where transactions are stored before they are adde a block. Every participant of the P2P distributed network has their own mempool on their computer.
- The 51% attack is when a group of hidden participants with majority computational power conduct mining without announcing their version of the chain to the rest of the network. The attackers can benefit by leveraging the double-spend problem.
- UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output): In cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, an unspent transaction output is an abstraction of electronic money. Each UTXO is analogous to a coin, and holds a certain amount of value in its respective currency.
- Wallet calculate your total UTXO belonging to you.

- SegWit (Segregated Witness): is the process by which the block size limit on a blockchain is increased by removing signature data from transactions that are included in each block. 
- Bank - there is a concept of 'balance'. Transactions add or take away from that balance. In blockchain, each transaction has a life of its own and has to start from another transaction(s) and end into other transaction(s), and there is no concept of 'balance'. What a cryptocurrency wallet demonstrates is simply an aggregation of all the transactions which exist on the blockchain and include you as either a sender or recipient.
- Fees constitute the difference between a transaction's inputs and outputs. Anything that is unused is given to the miner, and that's how you can choose what fee you want to pay.
- Bitcoin Address is the SHA256 encrypted version of the Public Key. This is done for additional security in case the Elliptic Curve is hacked.
- What making the blockchain a cryptocurrency is the transactions.
- What is Ethereum? It is a project created by Vitalik Buterin (was 19 yo). Bitcoin and Ethereum are friends, because both exist on protocol (coin), with different purpose, and Ethereum have a token while Bitcoin do not.
- Bitcoin vs Ethereum Design:
		- Founder: Satoshi Nakamoto <----> Vatalik Buterin
		- Genesis: January 2009 <----> July 2015
		- Code: Non Turning (Script) <----> Turning Complete (Solidity, Serpent, LLL or Mutan)
		- Leger: UTXO - Transaction <----> State - Account Based
		- Merkle Trees: Transaction <----> Transaction, State, Storage, Receipts
		- Block Time: 10 minutes <----> 14 seconds
		- Consensus: Proof of Work <----> Proof of Work
		- Hash Function: SHA 256 <----> Ethash
		- Currency: Bitcoin <----> ETH
		- Mining: ASIC <----> GPU
		- Hashrate: 54 Exahash/S <----> 260 Terahash/S
