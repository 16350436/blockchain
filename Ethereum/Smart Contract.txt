- A contract is a set of rules that parties agree on.
- Read more about Bitcoin Script (Bitcoin. Not Turing-Complete) and Solidity (Ethereum. Turing-Complete).
- Turing completeness means you can program anything in that language. (Wikipedia: This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets).
- Whitepaper: https://www.provenance.org/whitepaper
- Decentralized Applications (DApps): DApps are often referred to as smart contracts. Example: Steemit.com.
- How come Ethereum loop not a potential threat? If someone write a virus and send it to Blockchian, it will be in everybody computer! What if this smart contract get access to your private file? Ethereum Virtual Machine & Gas, a virtual environment isolated from your device, anything happens in the virtual environment stay their.

- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Replacing people with smart contracts.
- Hard Fork means that there is a new upgrade to the software on the blockchain software, which allows sending thing that not possible.
- Ethereum Classic (2017 - Block Number: 1919999) happened because there is a DOS attack, because some miners didn't agree to return the money back.
- In a nutshell, Vitalik Buterin trying to build with Ethereum the world's largest super-computer.
- Smart Contract is a program (code) which is run on blockchain.
- Gas is used by applications to pay for running operations on user machines.
- A soft fork is backwards compatible, a hard fork is not.
- The purpose of a whitepaper in a Blockchain project is to describe how the project is different to alternatives and how it will improve the world, to describe how the project will leverage the different properties of blockchain, and to describe why the project needs its own token (or coain) if an ICO has been proposed.
- Browser-based allows writing Ethereum Smart Contract without having to set up anything on the development environment: https://remix.ethereum.org/
- Bitcoin, one of revolutionary protocol using blockchain technology.
- Ethereum released a white paper describing a new protocol called Ethereum, which used this same blockchain infrastructure but with an additional feature (people can make entirely decentralized applications and organizations and build smart contracts and engage in agreements without a third-party intermediary or centralized governing force).
- Bitcoin developers they view the Bitcoin network as an asset, whereas Ethereum developers viewed it as an asset and also a utility.
- Blockchain is immutable. 
- Smart Contract may not not be 'Smart'. A lot of people have come to be calling them dumb contracts that are just algorithms that perform a function, it is not an artificial intelligence.



- Normally, for any technology that you learn, the history of how it was created is not always super important. For example, when you learn about HTML, you don't always learn about who first created HTML.
- October 31, 2008 ===> Original Bitcoin white-paper (academic document) date.
- The only purpose of Bitcoin was to enable financial transactions. That was it. No long after its release, many people realised that they could use some of Bitcoin original innovations to not only handle the transfer of currency, but other types of exchanges as well. One person who felt very strongly about this was named Vitalik Buterin (late 2013)
- A Smart Contract is a piece of code that lives in the Ethereum blockchain.
- There are many different Ethereum networks.
- The public key and the private key are used to authorize the sending of funds from your account to other accounts. So if someone does not have the private key to an account, they don't have true access to any of the funds that assigned to that account.
- The account address, public and private key are all stored as hexadecimal numbers. (Go to Chrome > Console > <Paste the Hex numbers> > Enter > See the result of a base 10 number).
- When signing up for an email address at Gmail and then going over Yahoo and signing up for an email address, you're creating two distinctly separate accounts. We only every are going to work with one account, but that one account is going to connect to all the different Ethereum networks that are out there (Main, Ropsten, Koven, Rinkeby).
