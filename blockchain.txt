- A blockchain is a decentralized immutable ledger which is continuously growing.
- A hash algorithm has to be only one-way (cannot be reverse-engineered), and has to be deterministic (same input generates same output every time), and has to have the Avalanche effect (any minor change to inputs changes the output completely and unpredictably)
- Distributed P2P Network property of Blockchain enhance the security of this technology. Every participant of the network has a copy of the full blockchain, and all participants are synced up. Therefore, if an attacker modifies the blockchain on one of the computers in the network, they are modifying only one single copy of the blockchain. The network will see this, compare it to the prevailing majority of versions of the blockchain in the network, and very quickly override the fraudulent version.
- Mining is all about finding a Nonce value which will generate a Hash value below a certain target threshold set by the Bitcoin network.
- A Consensus Protocol is a process used to achieve agreement between participants of a distributed network.
