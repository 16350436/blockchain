- A blockchain is a decentralized immutable ledger which is continuously growing.
- A hash algorithm has to be only one-way (cannot be reverse-engineered), and has to be deterministic (same input generates same output every time), and has to have the Avalanche effect (any minor change to inputs changes the output completely and unpredictably)
- Distributed P2P Network property of Blockchain enhance the security of this technology. Every participant of the network has a copy of the full blockchain, and all participants are synced up. Therefore, if an attacker modifies the blockchain on one of the computers in the network, they are modifying only one single copy of the blockchain. The network will see this, compare it to the prevailing majority of versions of the blockchain in the network, and very quickly override the fraudulent version.
- Mining is all about finding a Nonce value which will generate a Hash value below a certain target threshold set by the Bitcoin network.
- A Consensus Protocol is a process used to achieve agreement between participants of a distributed network.

- The next big thing in the technology industry is blockchain, as internet affected everything in the industry, blockchain will do the same.
When we talk about distributed (decentralisation), there are two main things; Security and trust.
- For security, there is a solution, which is Asymmetric Cryptography.
- How can blockchain make sure that there is no double-spending, and the money that is sent is not with the sender anymore. This is the trust question, and here comes Ledger.
- Every machine is called a Node.
- Central database can be changed. The solution is to have a Ledger in every machine, and no one can play with it and change it.
- We can use this concept for e.g. personal information, everything can be stored in block.
- Hashing means using different algorithms to generate simple hash key, it can be any algorithms, we have MD5, SHA- 256, etc. The awesome thing is that it does not matter how big your input is, you will get the same length, and for every data the key will be different, even if you change one letter.
- It does not matter which industry you work for, all of them are trying to implement blockchain. 
- Keywords: Confidentiality, Integrity, Non-repudiation, Authentication, Cryptograph, Encryption, Decryption.
- Types of Cryptography: 1. Symmetric Key Cryptography:  2. Asymmetric Key Cryptography -> Private Key & Public Key
- Types of Blockchain: 1. Public Blockchain 2. Private Blockchain 3. Federated Blockchain
